# Option Pricing

The `options` module provides classes and functions for pricing and analyzing options.
The main class is the [VolSurface][quantflow.options.surface.VolSurface] class which is used to represent a volatility surface for a given asset.
A volatility surface is usually created via a [VolSurfaceLoader][quantflow.options.surface.VolSurfaceLoader] object.
