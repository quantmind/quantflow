# Characteristic Function

The library makes heavy use of characteristic function concept and therefore, it is useful to familiarize with it.

## Definition

The characteristic function of a random variable $x$ is the Fourier (inverse) transform of $P^x$, where $P^x$ is the distrubution measure of $x$
\begin{equation}
 \Phi_{x,u} = {\mathbb E}\left[e^{i u x_t}\right] = \int e^{i u x} P^x\left(dx\right)
\end{equation}

## Properties

* $\Phi_{x, 0} = 1$
* it is bounded, $\left|\Phi_{x, u}\right| \le 1$
* it is Hermitian, $\Phi_{x, -u} = \overline{\Phi_{x, u}}$
* it is continuous
* characteristic function of a symmetric random variable is real-valued and even
* moments of $x$ are given by
\begin{equation}
    {\mathbb E}\left[x^n\right] = i^{-n} \left.\frac{\Phi_{x, u}}{d u}\right|_{u=0}
\end{equation}

## Covolution

The characteristic function is a great tool for working with linear combination of random variables.

* if $x$ and $y$ are independent random variables then the characteristic function of the linear combination $a x + b y$ ($a$ and $b$ are constants) is

\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{ax+bx,u} = \Phi_{x,a u}\Phi_{y,b u}
\end{equation}

* which means, if $x$ and $y$ are independent, the characteristic function of $x+y$ is the product
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{x+x,u} = \Phi_{x,u}\Phi_{y,u}
\end{equation}
* The characteristic function of $ax+b$ is
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{ax+b,u} = e^{iub}\Phi_{x,au}
\end{equation}

## Inversion

There is a one-to-one correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, so it is possible to find one of these functions if we know the other.

### Continuous distributions

The inversion formula for these distributions is given by

\begin{equation}
    {\mathbb P}\left(x\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-iuk}\Phi_{x, u} du
\end{equation}

### Discrete distributions

In these distributions, the random variable $x$ takes integer values. For example, the Poisson distribution is discrete.
The inversion formula for these distributions is given by

\begin{equation}
    {\mathbb P}\left(x=k\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{-iuk}\Phi_{x, u} du
\end{equation}
